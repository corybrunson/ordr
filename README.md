# ordr

**ordr** integrates ordination analysis and biplot visualization into
[**tidyverse**](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse) workflows.

## motivation

> Wherever there is an SVD, there is a biplot.[1]

### ordination and biplots

*Ordination* is a catch-all term for a variety of statistical techniques
that introduce an artificial coordinate system for a data set in such a
way that a few coordinates capture a large amount of the data structure
[2]. The branch of mathematical statistics called [geometric data
analysis](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781402022357) (GDA) provides
the theoretical basis for (most of) these techniques. Ordination
overlaps with regression and with dimension reduction, which can be
[contrasted to clustering and
classification](https://towardsdatascience.com/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning-14f68e32ea8d)
in that they assign continuous rather than discrete values to data
elements [3].

Most ordination techniques decompose a numeric rectangular data set into
the product of two matrices, often using singular value decomposition
(SVD). The coordinates of the shared dimensions of these matrices (over
which they are multiplied) are the artificial coordinates. In some
cases, such as principal components analysis, the decomposition is
exact; in others, such as non-negative matrix factorization, it is
approximate. Some techniques, such as correspondence analysis, transform
the data before decomposition. Ordination techniques may be supervised,
like linear discriminant analysis, or unsupervised, like
multidimensional scaling.

Analysis pipelines that use these techniques may use the artificial
coordinates directly, in place of natural coordinates, to arrange and
compare data elements or to predict responses. This is possible because
both the rows and the columns of the original table can be located, or
positioned, along these shared coordinates. The number of artificial
coordinates used in an application, such as regression or visualization,
is called the *rank* of the ordination [4]. A common application is the
*biplot*, which positions the rows and columns of the original table in
a scatterplot in 1, 2, or 3 artificial coordinates, usually those that
explain the most variation in the data.

### implementations in R

An extensive range of ordination techniques are implemented in R, from
classical multidimensional scaling (`stats::cmdscale()`) and principal
components analysis (`stats::prcomp()` and `stats::princomp()`) in the
**stats** package distributed with base R, across widely-used
implementations of linear discriminant analysis (`MASS::lda()`) and
correspondence analysis (`ca::ca()`) in general-use statistical
packages, to highly specialized packages that implement cutting-edge
techniques or adapt conventional techniques to challenging settings.
These implementations come with their own conventions, tailored to the
research communities that produced them, and it would be impractical
(and probably unhelpful) to try to consolidate them.

Instead, **ordr** provides a streamlined process by which the models
output by these methods—in particular, the matrix factors into which the
original data are approximately decomposed and the artificial
coordinates they share—can be inspected, annotated, tabulated,
summarized, and visualized. On this last point, most biplot
implementations in R provide limited customizability. **ordr** adopts
the grammar of graphics paradigm from
[**ggplot2**](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) to modularize and
standardize biplot elements [5]. Overall, the package is designed to
follow the broader syntactic conventions of the **tidyverse**, so that
users familiar with a this workflow can more easily and quickly
integrate ordination models into practice.

## usage

### installation

**ordr** remains under development and is not scheduled for a CRAN
release. For now, it can be installed from the (default) `main` branch
using [**remotes**](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes):

``` r
remotes::install_github("corybrunson/ordr")
```

### example

> Morphologically, *Iris versicolor* is much closer to *Iris virginica*
> than to *Iris setosa*, though in every character by which it differs
> from *Iris virginica* it departs in the direction of *Iris setosa*.[6]

A very common illustration of ordination in R applies principal
components analysis (PCA) to Anderson’s iris measurements. These data
consist of lengths and widths of the petals and surrounding sepals from
50 each of three species of iris:

``` r
head(iris)
#>   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
#> 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
#> 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
#> 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
#> 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
summary(iris)
#>   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   
#>  Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100  
#>  1st Qu.:5.100   1st Qu.:2.800   1st Qu.:1.600   1st Qu.:0.300  
#>  Median :5.800   Median :3.000   Median :4.350   Median :1.300  
#>  Mean   :5.843   Mean   :3.057   Mean   :3.758   Mean   :1.199  
#>  3rd Qu.:6.400   3rd Qu.:3.300   3rd Qu.:5.100   3rd Qu.:1.800  
#>  Max.   :7.900   Max.   :4.400   Max.   :6.900   Max.   :2.500  
#>        Species  
#>  setosa    :50  
#>  versicolor:50  
#>  virginica :50  
#>                 
#>                 
#> 
```

**ordr** provides a convenience function to send a subset of columns to
an ordination function, wrap the resulting model in the
[**tibble**](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble)-derived ‘tbl\_ord’
class, and append both model diagnostics and other original data columns
as annotations to the appropriate matrix factors:[7]

``` r
(iris_pca <- ordinate(iris, cols = 1:4, model = ~ prcomp(., scale. = TRUE)))
#> # A tbl_ord of class 'prcomp': (150 x 4) x (4 x 4)'
#> # 4 coordinates: PC1, PC2, ..., PC4
#> # 
#> # Rows (principal): [ 150 x 4 | 1 ]
#>     PC1    PC2     PC3 ... |   Species
#>                            |   <fct>  
#> 1 -2.26 -0.478  0.127      | 1 setosa 
#> 2 -2.07  0.672  0.234  ... | 2 setosa 
#> 3 -2.36  0.341 -0.0441     | 3 setosa 
#> 4 -2.29  0.595 -0.0910     | 4 setosa 
#> 5 -2.38 -0.645 -0.0157     | 5 setosa 
#> # … with 145 more rows
#> # 
#> # Columns (standard): [ 4 x 4 | 3 ]
#>      PC1     PC2    PC3 ... |   .name        .center .scale
#>                             |   <chr>          <dbl>  <dbl>
#> 1  0.521 -0.377   0.720     | 1 Sepal.Length    5.84  0.828
#> 2 -0.269 -0.923  -0.244 ... | 2 Sepal.Width     3.06  0.436
#> 3  0.580 -0.0245 -0.142     | 3 Petal.Length    3.76  1.77 
#> 4  0.565 -0.0669 -0.634     | 4 Petal.Width     1.20  0.762
```

Additional annotations can be added using several row- and
column-specific **dplyr**-style verbs:

``` r
iris_meta <- data.frame(
  Species = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"),
  Colony = c(1L, 1L, 2L),
  Cytotype = c("diploid", "hexaploid", "tetraploid"),
  Ploidy = c(2L, 6L, 4L)
)
(iris_pca <- left_join_rows(iris_pca, iris_meta, by = "Species"))
#> # A tbl_ord of class 'prcomp': (150 x 4) x (4 x 4)'
#> # 4 coordinates: PC1, PC2, ..., PC4
#> # 
#> # Rows (principal): [ 150 x 4 | 4 ]
#>     PC1    PC2     PC3 ... |   Species Colony Cytotype Ploidy
#>                            |   <chr>    <int> <chr>     <int>
#> 1 -2.26 -0.478  0.127      | 1 setosa       1 diploid       2
#> 2 -2.07  0.672  0.234  ... | 2 setosa       1 diploid       2
#> 3 -2.36  0.341 -0.0441     | 3 setosa       1 diploid       2
#> 4 -2.29  0.595 -0.0910     | 4 setosa       1 diploid       2
#> 5 -2.38 -0.645 -0.0157     | 5 setosa       1 diploid       2
#> # … with 145 more rows
#> # 
#> # Columns (standard): [ 4 x 4 | 3 ]
#>      PC1     PC2    PC3 ... |   .name        .center .scale
#>                             |   <chr>          <dbl>  <dbl>
#> 1  0.521 -0.377   0.720     | 1 Sepal.Length    5.84  0.828
#> 2 -0.269 -0.923  -0.244 ... | 2 Sepal.Width     3.06  0.436
#> 3  0.580 -0.0245 -0.142     | 3 Petal.Length    3.76  1.77 
#> 4  0.565 -0.0669 -0.634     | 4 Petal.Width     1.20  0.762
```

Following the [**broom**](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom) package,
the `tidy()` method produces a tibble describing the model components,
in this case the principal coordinates, which is suitable for scree
plotting:

``` r
tidy(iris_pca) %T>% print() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .name, y = .prop_var)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Proportion of inertia") +
  ggtitle("PCA of Anderson's iris measurements",
          "Distribution of inertia")
#> # A tibble: 4 × 4
#>   .name .sdev .inertia .prop_var
#>   <fct> <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
#> 1 PC1   1.71    435.     0.730  
#> 2 PC2   0.956   136.     0.229  
#> 3 PC3   0.383    21.9    0.0367 
#> 4 PC4   0.144     3.09   0.00518
```

Following **ggplot2**, the `fortify()` method row-binds the factor
tibbles with an additional `.matrix` column. This is used by
`ggbiplot()` to redirect row- and column-specific plot layers to the
appropriate subsets:[8]

``` r
ggbiplot(iris_pca, sec.axes = "cols", scale.factor = 2) +
  geom_rows_point(aes(color = Species, shape = Species)) +
  stat_rows_ellipse(aes(color = Species), alpha = .5, level = .99) +
  geom_cols_vector() +
  geom_cols_text_radiate(aes(label = .name)) +
  expand_limits(y = c(-3.5, NA)) +
  ggtitle("PCA of Anderson's iris measurements",
          "99% confidence ellipses; variables use top & right axes")
```

### inspiration

This package was originally inspired by the **ggbiplot** extension
developed by [Vincent Q. Vu](https://github.com/vqv/ggbiplot), [Richard
J Telford](https://github.com/richardjtelford/ggbiplot), and [Vilmantas
Gegzna](https://github.com/GegznaV/ggbiplot), among others. So far as i
know, it first brought biplots into the **tidyverse** framework. The
motivation to unify a variety of ordination methods came from [several
books and
articles](https://www.barcelonagse.eu/research/publications/all?author=Michael%20Greenacre)
by Michael Greenacre, in particular [*Biplots in
Practice*](https://www.fbbva.es/microsite/multivariate-statistics/resources.html#biplots).
Thomas Lin Pedersen’s
[**tidygraph**](https://github.com/thomasp85/tidygraph) prequel to
**ggraph** finally induced the shift from the downstream generation of
scatterplots to the upstream handling and manipulating of ordination
models. Additional design elements and features have been informed by
the monograph
[*Biplots*](https://www.routledge.com/Biplots/Gower-Hand/p/book/9780412716300)
and the textbook [*Understanding
Biplots*](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Understanding+Biplots-p-9780470012550)
by John C. Gower, David J. Hand, Sugnet Gardner Lubbe, and Niel J. Le
Roux.

### notes

[1] Greenacre MJ (2010) *Biplots in Practice*. Fundacion BBVA, ISBN:
978-84-923846.
<https://www.fbbva.es/microsite/multivariate-statistics/biplots.html>

[2] The term *ordination* is most prevalent among ecologists; to my
knowledge, no catch-all term is in common use outside ecology.

[3] This is not a hard rule: PCA is often used to compress data before
clustering, and LDA uses dimension reduction to perform classification
tasks.

[4] Regression and clustering models, like classical [linear
regression](http://www.multivariatestatistics.org/chapter2.html) and
[*k*-means](http://joelcadwell.blogspot.com/2015/08/matrix-factorization-comes-in-many.html),
can also be understood as matrix decomposition approximations and even
visualized in biplots. Their shared coordinates, which are pre-defined
rather than artificial, are the predictor coefficients and the cluster
assignments, respectively. Methods for `stats::lm()` and
`stats::kmeans()`, for example, are implemented for the sake of novelty
and instruction, but are not widely used in practice.

[5] Biplot elments must be chosen with care, and it is useful and
appropriate that many model-specific biplot methods have limited
flexibility. This package adopts the trade-off articulated in
[Wilkinson’s *The Grammar of
Graphics*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/iI1kcgAACAAJ) (p. 15):
“This system is capable of producing some hideous graphics. There is
nothing in its design to prevent its misuse. … This system cannot
produce a meaningless graphic, however.”

Missouri Botanical Garden* **23**(3), 457-469+471-483+485-501+503-509.
<https://doi.org/10.2307/2394164>

[7] The data must be in the form of a data frame that can be understood
by the modeling function. Step-by-step methods also exist to build and
annotate a ‘tbl\_ord’ from a fitted ordination model.

[8] The radiating text geom, like several other features, is adapted
from the **ggbiplot** package.
